    <h1>About WebhookInbox</h1>
    <p>
        WebhookInbox is a web service and website that receives HTTP requests from external sources and stores the data of those requests for later retrieval. Each inbox is represented by a generated URL, which can be passed to other applications for use. If you're developing a service that makes HTTP callbacks, WebhookInbox can be used as a convenient way to examine what you're sending. Incoming request data is displayed on the WebhookInbox website in realtime as it happens.    </p>
    <p>
        There is also a <a href="/docs/api.html">REST API</a> available, meaning WebhookInbox can be used programmatically, for example by a browser app wishing to receive HTTP callbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The URLs generated by WebhookInbox can even be used with PubSubHubbub. You can create an inbox and subscribe its target URL to a PubSubHubbub service, and feed updates will be delivered to the inbox.
    </p>
    <p>
        WebhookInbox is <a href="https://github.com/fanout/webhookinbox">open source</a>. You can run your own instance if you'd like. It is built with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a>, <a href="http://pushpin.org/">Pushpin</a>, and <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.
